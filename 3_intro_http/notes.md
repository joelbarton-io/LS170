## **to focus on**

**role of http**

**break down http/urls into composite elements; understand purposes**


## **application layer/protocols**
- application layer does *NOT* include the application itself; rather a set pf protocols that provide communication services to applications
- application layer protocols focus on the structure of messages and what data is contained in the message
- focused on the rules of *how* applications talk to each other (the syntax of that communication)

## **http and the web**
- primary protocol used for communication on the Web
- 'web' and 'internet' are distinct; internet: network of networks that enable communication between networks; web: service accessed by internet
- HTTP is the primary means by which applications interact with resources on the web
- resources needed uniformity, earliest incarnation of the web was faciliated mainly through html, ur(i/l), and http
- http is a set of rules (protocol) which provide uniformity to the way resources on the web are transferred between applications

## **background and diagrams**
- understanding where you are when looking at a piece of code
- **a *"server's"* composition:**
  1. web server -> responds to requests for static assets (files, images, css, js...)
  2. application server -> server-side code lives, complex requests, business logic
  3. data store -> relational database; also simple files, key/value stores...

- **http, tcp/ip**
  - all three are separate protocols operating at different 'layers' of the network
  - http(s) operates at the application layer (messages between applications)
  - tcp/ip do all the heavy-lifting in the request response cycle between client and server

## **urls**
- URL is a subset of URI that includes the network location of some resource
